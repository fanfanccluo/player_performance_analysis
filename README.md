## Introduction
League of Legends (LoL) is one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games globally, with millions of players and a thriving professional esports community. The dataset used in this project, sourced from Oracleâ€™s Elixir, contains detailed match data from professional LoL esports matches throughout 2022. This dataset provides insights into gameplay metrics, player performance, and team dynamics, making it an invaluable resource for analyzing the factors contributing to success in professional matches. It captures information on individual player statistics, match outcomes, and in-game events. 

The main goal of this project is to investigate the **relationship between a player's character pool size and their winning rate**. This question challenges the assumption that mastering a wide array of characters necessarily leads to greater success in matches, providing insights into whether player skill or specialization is a more significant factor in determining outcomes.
